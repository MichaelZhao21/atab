# Task Tab!

[WIP!!!] This is an extension that will replace your new tab into a more productive and useful interface! The main feature is a todo list, stored on YOUR choice of storage platform: Google Drive, Dropbox, MongoDB, etc! For now, the main focus is for a Firefox extension, but once deployed, I hope to expand to Chrome too :)

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

Simply type `yarn install` to install :)

## Execution

To test it, just type `yarn start` and it will open in your browser :DDD

To build and deploy the extension, type `yarn build` and zip the files in `build/`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## TODO (future plans and stuff)

* Finish the basic app for personal use (using my own API for now)
* Create and host a dedicated backend, seperate from my own API (this will be a server folder in this repo)
* Add the ability for users to store in google drive, dropbox, etc
* Add instructions on how to self-host the backend
